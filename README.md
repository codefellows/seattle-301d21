Welcome to Code 301! This is a class that builds on your fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and general web development, to prepare you for the deep dive of any Code 401 class.

# Introduction

We are going to learn about many different topics of web development, including jQuery, templating, AJAX, databases, single-page applications, and state management. The overall structure of the course is based on Model-View-Controller (MVC), which is a common design pattern for web applications.

The general course schedule is:

Full Time  | Part Time    | Topic
-----------|--------------|---------------
Week 1     | Week 1 and 2 | The View
Week 2     | Week 3 and 4 | The Model
Week 3     | Week 5 and 6 | The Controller
Week 4     | Week 7 and 8 | Your Project

## Slides from class

- Slides will be shared via Slack after they are presented.

## Lecture Videos

- A YouTube playlist link will be shared via Slack out on the first day of class.  You can also find the link in the YouTube badge above.

## Assignments

Lab-time code assignments follow each lecture. Generally, you'll have a "pair" assignment that you'll work on with a classmate, and an individual "sandbox" assignment in which you'll build up your own online portfolio. Useful for your coming career change!

Instructions for completing and submitting the assignments can be found in the README files of the lab directories.

Assignments are submitted using a professional-grade Git-flow. If you haven't done so already, it's time to get comfortable with the core Git commands. Don't worry, we'll give you step-by-step help as needed.
